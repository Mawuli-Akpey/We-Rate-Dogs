# We Rate Dogs

## Dataset
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
By asking WeRateDogs to share with us some of their tweets, they did. They have shared 5000+ of
their tweets which contains some basic data. Sometimes in their brief panegyric they mention 
the breed of the dog, and some others they donâ€™t. But thanks to Udacity, they have performed 
some neutral network procedures to classify the dogs based on their images which are shared with 
the tweets.

The objective of this project is to gather data from different sources, to be assessed and then
to perform cleansing techniques to raise the quality and tidiness of the data. Hence, it can be
used in any later analysis.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In this report we tackle key insights form our WeRateDogs dataset problem. Each insight would be
delved into with theory behind the insight and supporting graphs to enhance understanding.

The following insights would be addressed:
1- Tweet numbers
2- Algorithm prediction
3- Dog stages
4- Ratings


This project file contains a report on the both the wrangle efforts used and visualisations in pdf.
